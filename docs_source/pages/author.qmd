Hello! My name is Victor De Lima. I'm a student interested in machine learning algorithms research, particularly in improving model performance in real-world applications, enhancing interpretability, and optimizing the trade-offs between model quality, training time, and financial cost. I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Science at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.

My professional journey spans multiple roles and industries. I began my career in data analytics consulting, a foundation I later built upon in the finance industry to develop cutting-edge bond, company, and market analysis models. In the summer of 2023, I held the position of Data Scientist with the Arlington County Government. 

My experience also includes various research projects, such as using machine learning methods for recommendation systems and materials science problems. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at Georgetown's AI-Measurement and Data Science lab. Complementing my research, actively engaging in Teaching Assistant roles has significantly enhanced my academic journey. Eager to further deepen my expertise, I am currently intent on pursuing a Ph.D.

Throughout my studies, I've concentrated on subjects such as optimization, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. I actively use machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and Scikit-learn in my projects and research work. Despite my preference for Python, my toolkit comprises various programming languages and complementary tools, such as R and LaTeX. 

When not crunching numbers or writing code, I love exploring physics and mathematics concepts and listening to great science communicators.
