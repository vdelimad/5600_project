### Public Expenditure on Space Exploration {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The data on Public Expenditure on Space Exploration, sourced from @us_bureau_of_economic_analysis_government_nodate, traces the financial commitment of the United States to space exploration initiatives from the late 1950s. This dataset reveals a progressive increase in spending over the initial years, starting from a modest 0.150 billion dollars in 1959. The trend of escalating investment is further underscored by the 1963 figure, which rose quickly to 1.801 billion dollars, showcasing the U.S.'s commitment to establishing its presence in space and achieving technological supremacy during the Cold War era. As of 2022, this figure had grown to 15.5 billion dollars. 

Here is a view of a sample of the data [@us_bureau_of_economic_analysis_government_nodate]:

```{python}
#| echo: false

public_expenditure = pd.read_csv(f'../../../data/raw/public_sector/fred/government_space_expenditures.csv')

### Mars Curiosity Rover Weather Data {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The Mars Curiosity Rover Weather Data, collected from @centro_de_astrobiologia_csic-inta_rems_nodate using Python's `selenium` library, offers detailed meteorological observations from the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) aboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. This dataset captures various aspects of the Martian atmosphere, such as air and ground temperatures, pressure, and ultraviolet radiation levels, with daily variability influenced by the rover's activities and environmental factors like temperature, orientation, shading, and dust accumulation. For instance, in late January 2024, during Mars' autumn season, the data shows a fluctuation in air temperature ranging from -1°C to 3°C for maximums and plummeting to as low as -75°C for minimums. Ground temperatures varied between 13°C and 16°C for maximums, with minimums reaching down to -84°C. The code used to collect the data is available [here](https://github.com/vdelimad/5600_project/blob/main/notebooks/1_data_collection/mars_widget_data_collect.ipynb), and the data used to process it is available [here](https://github.com/vdelimad/5600_project/blob/main/notebooks/2_data_processing/mars_widget_data_process.ipynb). Additional data containing the year starts and seasons in Mars based on longitudes was obtained from @the_planetary_society_mars_2024.

### Google Trends Data {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The Google Trends data provides insights into the public interest in topics of Mars [@google_trends_mars_nodate], Space Exploration [@google_trends_space_nodate], SpaceX [@google_trends_spacex_nodate] and Satellites [@google_trends_satellites_nodate] and satellites over five years. By examining weekly search volumes in the United States, we can observe fluctuations in interest levels. These numbers reflect the relative search interest in space exploration, indicating how public engagement with the topic changes over time. This data can be helpful to understand trends, seasonal variations, or impacts of specific events on the public's interest in space-related topics.

### Satellite Data {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The data extracted from @world_meteorological_organization_list_nodate, the Meteorological Satellite Launch Database encompasses various information such as the satellite's name, its official U.N. registry country, the operator or owner country, the entity managing it, its intended users, purpose, and more specific operational details. For instance, the dataset includes 1HOPSAT-TD, a high optical performance satellite by Hera Systems for Earth observation through infrared imaging in a low Earth orbit (LEO), with a launch date of November 12, 2019. This dataset shows the global engagement in space exploration and utilization for varied purposes, from commercial to educational. Additionally, the Satellites Currently in Orbit Dataset from @union_of_concerned_scientists_ucs_2023 shows similar information but is limited to active satellites.
