    "section": "1.3 Literature Review",
    "text": "1.3 Literature Review\nThis literature review focuses on exploring the trends in the space exploration industry. The overview includes economic prospects and technological advancements to governmental investments and the role of private enterprises in shaping the industry.\n\nEconomic Prospects\nSpace exploration is on the brink of becoming a trillion-dollar industry by 2040, according to Morgan Stanley (2020), propelled by declining launch costs, technological advancements, and increased interest from the public and private sectors. With satellite broadband expected to account for half of this growth, introducing reusable rockets and mass-produced satellites promises to slash expenses further, opening up new possibilities such as high-speed global delivery systems and commercial space travel.\n\n\nTechnological Advancements\nThe unveiling of the James Webb Space Telescope’s first images in 2022 represented a landmark moment in space exploration, highlighting the synergy between space agencies (NASA, E.S.A., C.S.A.) and the transformative impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Signé & Dooley (2023)). This era is marked by the fusion of technologies across digital, physical, and biological spheres, leading to reduced costs and the proliferation of smaller satellites. These advancements are democratizing space access and bringing in a variety of new participants, including private companies and emerging space nations, despite challenges like geopolitical tensions and the necessity for inclusive, equitable regulations.\n\n\nGovernmental Investments\nOn the governmental front, Sadek (2022) predicts a global space exploration investment surge to $31 billion by 2031, focusing on transportation, orbital infrastructure, and lunar ventures. This increase is buoyed by heightened cooperation across nations and sectors, aiming for a sustainable lunar presence and extended human activity in low Earth orbit. Noteworthy is the diversification of the space exploration field with new entrants like Australia and the U.A.E., alongside significant projects like the Artemis program and the International Lunar Research Station, signaling a shift towards more inclusive and collaborative space endeavors.\nNASA’s contributions to the economy and space exploration have been substantial, generating over $71.2 billion in economic output and supporting more than 339,600 jobs in 2021, as reported by Dunbar (2022). This impact stems from its Moon to Mars missions, climate change research, and the creation of high-quality jobs across the United States, underlining NASA’s pivotal role in fostering economic growth and cementing American leadership in global space exploration and science.\n\n\nThe role of private enterprises in shaping the industry\nLastly, the space sector has witnessed a remarkable surge in investment, growing to more than $10 billion annually by 2021 from $300 million in 2012 (Bland et al. (2022)). This influx drives innovation and competition, with companies increasingly adopting commercial models and focusing on intellectual property, especially in lower Earth orbit and potential operations between the Earth and the Moon. The industry’s evolution is characterized by strategic mergers, product innovation, and a disruptive approach to securing market dominance, indicating a dynamic and competitive future landscape for space exploration and utilization.\nThe space exploration industry is rapidly evolving, with significant economic opportunities, technological breakthroughs, governmental investments, and private sector innovation.

These panels tell the ongoing story of a planet being observed, analyzed, and understood, piece by piece, season by season, year by Martian year.\nIn the upper left, we have a panel capturing the varying sunrise and sunset times. The fluctuation is depicted as a yellow band against a dark background, a visual metaphor for daylight hours. Below this, the bottom left panel portrays ground temperature, with vertical bars in seasonal colors representing the minimum and maximum temperatures recorded. The colors (blue for winter, green for spring, orange for summer, and red for autumn) create a thermal theme to the figure, highlighting the cold dominance of the Martian climate, where even summer days struggle to reach above freezing.\nTo the right, the upper panel focuses on atmospheric pressure, with a series of box and whisker plots organized by Martian months. Each plot is a snapshot of variability, with the boxes indicating the middle 50% of recorded pressures and the whiskers extending to the extremes. The data suggests a degree of predictability in the expected pressure on Mars. The final panel, bottom right, shifts to air temperature, charted over Martian months with a color gradient that speaks to temperature intensity. Each year is a line of colored squares, each square a month, and each shade a degree, telling a story of a cold planet.\nThe data shown in the dashboard shows the outcomes of public investment in space infrastructure. The gathering of Martian environmental data is made possible by the advanced technology aboard the Curiosity Rover, showing how dedicating resources towards the pursuit of knowledge beyond our planet is a stepping stone for humanity’s aspirations in space, providing invaluable insights that could shape the future of space exploration and colonization. Furthermore, for those who might one day set foot on Mars, this data is a source for preparation. It offers a preview of the challenges to be faced in a hostile environment."

The series has shown a general direction of stability, with evident yearly seasonal patterns that reflect the planet’s four distinct seasons. Interestingly, over the past five years, data suggest a slight decrease in temperature, hinting that Mars has been trending warmer. This series is additive.\nSeas. 2: Mars Pressure. When examining Mars’ Pressure, a downward trend is noticeable. Like its temperature, Mars exhibits clear yearly seasonal patterns corresponding to its four seasons. The pattern of Mars’s atmospheric pressure is also additive.\nFinancial 1: ARKX. The trajectory of ARKX has been on a downward slope. Its performance has been highly volatile, significantly influenced by the interest rate hike cycle that began in 2022. This cycle was particularly detrimental to technology stocks, affecting the overall valuation of ARKX. ARKX is a multiplicative series.\nFinancial 2: AVAV. Contrary to ARKX, AVAV has been trending upward overall despite experiencing high volatility. The same interest rate hike cycle that started in 2022, which negatively impacted technology stocks, applies here. However, AVAV has navigated these challenges more successfully. Also like ARKX, AVAV is a multiplicative series.\nTreasury NASA Outlays. The outlays have been consistently moving upward, with a steady increase observed. A notable dip in 2019 stands out, but it is considered an anomaly and not representative of the overall upward trend, as it is a single month. The growth in NASA’s budget outlays is multiplicative.\nGoogle Trends. In Google Trends for the Space Exploration term, there’s been an increasing general direction despite several fluctuations. The series is multiplicative.\nLaunches. The number of launches of weather satellites has shown an interesting pattern, decreasing from 1960 to 2010 but experiencing a resurgence recently. Despite multiple fluctuations, this rebound suggests a renewed interest or advancement in space exploration technologies. The series is multiplicative.\nSatellites. The number of operational satellites has been clearly trending upward. Although there have been multiple fluctuations, the overall trajectory steadily increased, with a sharp rise observed in the past year. This indicates a significant expansion in satellite technology and deployment. The series is multiplicative."

An inverse correlation is particularly noticeable at a lag of six months, while a high positive correlation emerges at the twelve-month mark. Between these points, the patterns rotate around these mentioned correlations, showcasing the planet’s distinct seasonal changes. This cyclical pattern reflects the Martian climate’s balance, oscillating between warming and cooling as the Martian year progresses.\nSeas. 2: Mars Pressure Monthly. Similarly, Mars’s pressure data exhibits seasonal characteristics but with a notable distinction. The clear seasonal pattern emerges predominantly at the twelve-month lag, with less clarity in the monthly correlations from months one through eleven. This highlights the unique environmental dynamics of the planet.\nFinancial 1: ARKX. The ARKX financial data demonstrates a common trait of financial instruments, where the correlation is strongest at a one-day lag and gradually weakens over time. This pattern indicates the short-term momentum often observed in financial markets, where recent past performance can strongly influence immediate future performance. However, this influence diminishes as the gap widens.\nFinancial 2: AVAV. The AVAV lag plots mirror the correlation pattern seen in ARKX, with a strong initial correlation that weakens progressively. This again underscores the principle that recent performance is a stronger predictor of the near future than of more distant periods.\nTreasury NASA Outlays Monthly. For Treasury NASA Outlays, the data shows the strongest positive correlation at a twelve-month lag, yet overall, the correlations are not particularly strong. This indicates that while there is some seasonality to NASA’s budget outlays, it does not follow as predictable a pattern as some other seasonal data, suggesting that other factors play significant roles in budget fluctuations.\nGoogle Trends Weekly. Google Trends data, observed weekly, displays a pattern similar to that of financial data, with a strong correlation at the first lag that significantly weakens after that. By the twelfth week, the correlation becomes nearly indiscernible. This highlights the fast-moving nature of internet search trends, where interests shift quickly.\nWeather Satellite Launches Monthly. The correlation in monthly weather satellite launches is very weak across the board from months one through twelve. This indicates a lack of a strong seasonal or time-based pattern in the launching of weather satellites, suggesting that other factors, such as technological advancements or specific weather monitoring needs may more influence launches.\nOperational Satellites Monthly. The monthly data on operational satellites shows a strong correlation at the first lag, similar to financial data, but this correlation weakens more slowly over time. This suggests a steadier and more predictable growth pattern or change in the number of operational satellites, following a more consistent trajectory."

As expected, due to the seasonal nature of temperature data, there are significant lags, particularly at 6-month and 12-month intervals. For ARIMA model parameters, p could be any value from 1 to 10, while q, based on the PACF, could be 1, 2, or 3. These plots indicate that the series is not stationary.\nSeas. 2: Mars Pressure. Consistent with patterns observed in temperature data, Mars pressure shows significant seasonal correlations, primarily annually. According to the ACF, p could range from 1 to 7, while the PACF suggests that q could be 1, 2, 3, or 4. These observations imply that the series is not stationary.\nFinancial 1: ARKX. The ACF indicates a decreasing lag, typical for financial data, which could suggest a mean-reverting process. The PACF identifies the only significant lag at 0, indicating that the series may benefit from focusing on immediate past values for predictions.\nFinancial 2: AVAV. Exhibits a pattern similar to ARKX with a decreasing lag in the ACF and significant lag at 0 in the PACF, suggesting that the model parameters for AVAV might closely align with those determined for ARKX, focusing on immediate past values for predictions.\nTreasury NASA Outlays. This series displays a distinct pattern, with significant correlations at every third lag (3, 6, 9, 12, and so on) in the ACF, indicating a quarterly seasonal pattern. The PACF shows significance at lags 3, 7, and 12, suggesting potential values for q. This pattern indicates a more complex seasonal model, necessitating differencing.\nGoogle Trends. This data behaves similarly to the stock patterns observed in the ACF and PACF, hinting at short-term correlations that might be exploited in predictive modeling, much like financial time series data.\nLaunches. The ACF for this series shows autocorrelation across all 28 lags displayed, while the PACF indicates significance in the first seven lags. This extensive autocorrelation suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing launch frequencies, suggesting a detailed ARIMA model may be required to capture the underlying patterns accurately.\nSatellites. The ACF for satellite data shows autocorrelation across all 24 lags displayed, suggesting a persistent pattern over time, while the PACF highlights significance only in the first lag. This indicates a potentially simpler ARIMA model could be applied, focusing on immediate past values for forecasting future data points."

We observe that, particularly with the series with seasonality, such as Mars Temperature and Mars Pressure, the 5-time step moving average sufficiently shows the underlying pattern losing too much information. In contrast, the longer SMAs tend to overly smooth the series, resulting in a loss of visible data trends. We see a similar pattern with the financial data series. Overall, the more volatility in the data, the more a larger time step blurs the underlying series."

This will be further discussed in the SARIMA section.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Forecast\n\nSeas. 1: Mars TemperatureSeas. 2: Mars PressureFinancial 1: ARKXFinancial 2: AVAVTreasury NASA OutlaysGoogle TrendsLaunchesSatellites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMars Temperature: The forecast follows the overall pattern of the data. However, it does not get the seasonality right.\nMars Pressure: The forecast gets the overall seasonality patterns wrong, but only the broader pattern is correct. It also captured the downward trend of the data.\nARKX: Since this model is a random walk, the forecast with the bands shows previous values and wide confidence bands.\nAVAV: Since this model is also a random walk, the forecast with the bands shows previous values and wide confidence bands.\nTreasury NASA Outlays: The forecast could only capture some of the seasonality; however, the model still needs improvement to capture the overall pattern.\nGoogle Trends: As previously established, this model requires additional terms, and, as such, the forecast takes a direction but without resembling the overall patterns in the data.\nLaunches: As previously established, this model requires additional terms, and as such, the forecast only reflects the highly volatile data.\nSatellites: This forecast is highly reflective of the data, given that it is mostly a drifting pattern.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.6 Benchmark Methods\n\nSeas. 1: Mars TemperatureSeas. 2: Mars PressureFinancial 1: ARKXFinancial 2: AVAVTreasury NASA OutlaysGoogle TrendsLaunchesSatellites\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nMetrics:\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nRMSE\nMSE\nMAE\n\n\n\n\nMean\n6.32513\n5.60803\n5.60803\n\n\nNaive\n3.99073\n3.28983\n3.28983\n\n\nSNaive\n2.74773\n2.17864\n2.17864\n\n\nRWF\n3.99073\n3.28983\n3.28983\n\n\nARIMA\n2.33199\n1.87184\n1.87184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nMetrics:\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nRMSE\nMSE\nMAE\n\n\n\n\nMean\n58.0269\n49.2388\n49.2388\n\n\nNaive\n42.6673\n36.3194\n36.3194\n\n\nSNaive\n12.644\n10.2099\n10.2099\n\n\nRWF\n42.6673\n36.3194\n36.3194\n\n\nARIMA\n11.4729\n9.14004\n9.14004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nMetrics:\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nRMSE\nMSE\nMAE\n\n\n\n\nMean\n2.83046\n2.48152\n2.48152\n\n\nNaive\n0.241389\n0.188894\n0.188894\n\n\nSNaive\n4.31569\n3.4923\n3.4923\n\n\nRWF\n0.241389\n0.188894\n0.188894\n\n\nARIMA\n0.241225\n0.188663\n0.188663\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nMetrics:\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nRMSE\nMSE\nMAE\n\n\n\n\nMean\n16.8631\n13.0502\n13.0502\n\n\nNaive\n2.73346\n1.77323\n1.77323\n\n\nSNaive\n22.9545\n19.3187\n19.3187\n\n\nRWF\n2.73346\n1.77323\n1.77323\n\n\nARIMA\n2.73159\n1.77096\n1.77096\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nMetrics:\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nRMSE\nMSE\nMAE\n\n\n\n\nMean\n353.807\n271.601\n271.601\n\n\nNaive\n465.746\n358.741\n358.741\n\n\nSNaive\n253.909\n195.551\n195.551\n\n\nRWF\n465.746\n358.741\n358.741\n\n\nARIMA\n238.663\n188.885\n188.885\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nMetrics:\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nRMSE\nMSE\nMAE\n\n\n\n\nMean\n18.9977\n15.4921\n15.4921\n\n\nNaive\n10.9495\n7.90769\n7.90769\n\n\nSNaive\n18.4074\n14.2356\n14.2356\n\n\nRWF\n10.9495\n7.90769\n7.90769\n\n\nARIMA\n10.4846\n7.81022\n7.81022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nMetrics:\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nRMSE\nMSE\nMAE\n\n\n\n\nMean\n3.06655\n2.43\n2.43\n\n\nNaive\n3.45945\n2.65684\n2.65684\n\n\nSNaive\n3.16894\n2.42313\n2.42313\n\n\nRWF\n3.45945\n2.65684\n2.65684\n\n\nARIMA\n2.43236\n1.87856\n1.87856\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization:\n\nMetrics:\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nRMSE\nMSE\nMAE\n\n\n\n\nMean\n55.0698\n49.4044\n49.4044\n\n\nNaive\n4.81083\n2.5\n2.5\n\n\nSNaive\n19.6326\n17.6262\n17.6262\n\n\nRWF\n4.81083\n2.5\n2.5\n\n\nARIMA\n4.47817\n2.20521\n2.20521\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RMSE of the fitted models outperforms the benchmark methods Mean, Naive, SNaive, and RWF in all cases.
