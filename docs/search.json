    "section": "1.3 Literature Review",
    "text": "1.3 Literature Review\nThis literature review focuses on exploring the trends in the space exploration industry. The overview includes economic prospects and technological advancements to governmental investments and the role of private enterprises in shaping the industry.\n\nEconomic Prospects\nSpace exploration is on the brink of becoming a trillion-dollar industry by 2040, according to Morgan Stanley (2020), propelled by declining launch costs, technological advancements, and increased interest from the public and private sectors. With satellite broadband expected to account for half of this growth, introducing reusable rockets and mass-produced satellites promises to slash expenses further, opening up new possibilities such as high-speed global delivery systems and commercial space travel.\n\n\nTechnological Advancements\nThe unveiling of the James Webb Space Telescope’s first images in 2022 represented a landmark moment in space exploration, highlighting the synergy between space agencies (NASA, E.S.A., C.S.A.) and the transformative impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Signé & Dooley (2023)). This era is marked by the fusion of technologies across digital, physical, and biological spheres, leading to reduced costs and the proliferation of smaller satellites. These advancements are democratizing space access and bringing in a variety of new participants, including private companies and emerging space nations, despite challenges like geopolitical tensions and the necessity for inclusive, equitable regulations.\n\n\nGovernmental Investments\nOn the governmental front, Sadek (2022) predicts a global space exploration investment surge to $31 billion by 2031, focusing on transportation, orbital infrastructure, and lunar ventures. This increase is buoyed by heightened cooperation across nations and sectors, aiming for a sustainable lunar presence and extended human activity in low Earth orbit. Noteworthy is the diversification of the space exploration field with new entrants like Australia and the U.A.E., alongside significant projects like the Artemis program and the International Lunar Research Station, signaling a shift towards more inclusive and collaborative space endeavors.\nNASA’s contributions to the economy and space exploration have been substantial, generating over $71.2 billion in economic output and supporting more than 339,600 jobs in 2021, as reported by Dunbar (2022). This impact stems from its Moon to Mars missions, climate change research, and the creation of high-quality jobs across the United States, underlining NASA’s pivotal role in fostering economic growth and cementing American leadership in global space exploration and science.\n\n\nThe role of private enterprises in shaping the industry\nLastly, the space sector has witnessed a remarkable surge in investment, growing to more than $10 billion annually by 2021 from $300 million in 2012 (Bland et al. (2022)). This influx drives innovation and competition, with companies increasingly adopting commercial models and focusing on intellectual property, especially in lower Earth orbit and potential operations between the Earth and the Moon. The industry’s evolution is characterized by strategic mergers, product innovation, and a disruptive approach to securing market dominance, indicating a dynamic and competitive future landscape for space exploration and utilization.\nThe space exploration industry is rapidly evolving, with significant economic opportunities, technological breakthroughs, governmental investments, and private sector innovation. The synergy between public and private entities and international collaboration is essential for steady progress. This background sets the stage for addressing the analysis in the following sections."
