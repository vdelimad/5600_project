    "text": "Time Series\n\nWhat is a Time Series ?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes."

    "section": "1.3 Literature Review",
    "text": "1.3 Literature Review\nIn this review, we explore the transformative dynamics of the space exploration sector, from its economic prospects and technological advancements to governmental investments and the role of private enterprises in shaping the industry.\nSpace exploration is on the brink of becoming a trillion-dollar industry by 2040, according to Morgan Stanley (2020), propelled by declining launch costs, technological advancements, and increased interest from the public and private sectors. With satellite broadband expected to account for half of this growth, introducing reusable rockets and mass-produced satellites promises to slash expenses further, opening up new possibilities such as high-speed global delivery systems and commercial space travel. Nevertheless, the volatile history of space-related investments is a cautionary note for potential investors.\nThe unveiling of the James Webb Space Telescope’s first images in 2022 represented a landmark moment in space exploration, highlighting the synergy between major space agencies (NASA, E.S.A., C.S.A.) and the transformative impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Signé & Dooley (2023)). This era is marked by the fusion of technologies across digital, physical, and biological spheres, leading to reduced costs and the proliferation of smaller satellites. These advancements are democratizing space access and bringing in a variety of new participants, including private companies and emerging space nations, despite challenges like geopolitical tensions and the necessity for inclusive, equitable regulations.\nOn the governmental front, Sadek (2022) predicts a surge in global space exploration investment to $31 billion by 2031, focusing on transportation, orbital infrastructure, and lunar ventures. This increase is buoyed by heightened cooperation across nations and sectors, aiming for a sustainable lunar presence and extended human activity in low Earth orbit. Noteworthy is the diversification of the space exploration field with new entrants like Australia and the U.A.E., alongside significant projects like the Artemis program and the International Lunar Research Station, signaling a shift towards more inclusive and collaborative space endeavors.\nNASA’s contributions to the economy and space exploration have been substantial, generating over $71.2 billion in economic output and supporting more than 339,600 jobs in 2021, as reported by Dunbar (2022). This impact stems from its Moon to Mars missions, climate change research, and the creation of high-quality jobs across the United States, underlining NASA’s pivotal role in fostering economic growth and cementing American leadership in global space exploration and science.\nLastly, the space sector has witnessed a remarkable surge in investment, growing to more than $10 billion annually by 2021 from $300 million in 2012 (Bland et al. (2022)). This influx drives innovation and competition, with companies increasingly adopting commercial models and focusing on intellectual property, especially in lower Earth orbit and potential operations between the Earth and the Moon. The industry’s evolution is characterized by strategic mergers, product innovation, and a disruptive approach to securing market dominance, indicating a dynamic and competitive future landscape for space exploration and utilization."
